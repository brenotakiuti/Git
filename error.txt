When getting an autentication error, something like "failed to get certificate" and a portuguese description (dont know why portuguese):

1 - Delete all SSH keys;
2 - Check github settings to see if there are any SSH key left;
3 - Disconnect github from gitkraken;
4 - Reconnect;
5 - Generate new SSH key;

If this does not work:

3.5 - Disconnect github on html (site);
